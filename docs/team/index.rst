RSE Team and Salary
===================

The *RSE Team* view is available to all users  by selecting **Team->RSE Team** from the main menu. The view will display all team members, their usernames and capacity. For Admin users the team members current salary grade point will also be displayed. The :raw-html:`<i class="fa fa-edit"></i>` icon can be used to edit Salary Data for an RSE. The *Info* button will provide a `RSE Commitment Overview`_ for the individual staff member.


Edit Salary Data
----------------

A salary grade change represents a change to an RSEs salary. Salary grade changes can occur as a result of setting a starting salary or if there is a non incremental change to an RSE salary. Non incremental changes may be the result of promotion or demotion to a different salary grade or to reflect a point increment (from a non incremental salary grade point) due to exceptional contribution.

The *Edit Salary Data* view will by default have a single salary grade point change which reflects the starting salary of the RSE set when the RSE user was created. Additional salary grade changes can be made by using the drop downs and *Add Salary Grade Change Button*. Individual salary grade changes can be deleted using this view. WARNING: If you remove all salary grade changes then it will not be possible to calculate any cost for the RSE.

RSE Commitment Overview
-----------------------

The RSE commitment Overview provides both a stacked commitment graph showing allocations over time and a gantt view of commitments per project. The view can be filtered by date range and funding status. Within the commitment overview graph the red dashed line represents todays date. Hovering the mouse over each stepped point will provide a breakdown of the allocations which contribute to the commitment total. The :raw-html:`<i class="fa fa-expand"></i>` icon can be used to rescale the graph from 100% FTE to max (as the RSE may be over committed on projects which are under review).
