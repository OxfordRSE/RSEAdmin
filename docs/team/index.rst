RSE Team and Salary
===================

The *RSE Team* view is available to all users  by selecting **Team->RSE Team** from the main menu. The view will display all team members, their usernames and capacity. For Admin users the team members current salary grade point will also be displayed. The :raw-html:`<i class="fa fa-edit"></i>` icon can be used to edit Salary Data for an RSE.


Edit Salary Data
----------------

A salary grade change represents a chnage to an RSEs salary. Salary grade changes can occur as a result of setting a starting salary or if there is a non incremental change to an RSE salary. Non incremental changes may be the result of promotion or demotion to a different salary grade or to reflect a point increment (from a non incremental salary grade point) due to exceptional contribution.

The *Edit Salary Data* view will by default have a single salary grade point change which reflects the starting salary of the RSE set when the RSE user was created. Additional salary grade changes can be made by using the drop downs and *Add Salary Grade Change Button*. Individual salary grade changes can be deleted using this view. WARNING: If you remove all salary grade changes then it will not be possible to calculate any cost for the RSE.
